## Project Details

My project is an astronomy site where you can find different information about astronomy. The nav links include:

- Home
- About
- Space
- Earth
- News
- Sign In
- Register

Home:<br>
Starts off with a beautiful banner image. This page has an API retrieved from NASA that when the button is clicked, it will display the astronomy picture of the day. I added this in because I thought it was a fun API that could catch the audience's attention right on the home page. The home page also has the top news articles and a button that links to the actual news page.

About, Space, Earth:<br>
These pages just have images and are meant to hold general information about the site creators, space, and the Earth respectively.

News:<br>
This page holds some news articles. When you click on them, you can view them individually and the user can create a comment, and edit or delete their comment.

Sign In and Register:<br>
These pages of course display inputs for the user to login or create an account.
